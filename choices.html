            <h3>Advancing bionic technology</h3>
            <p>The use of a digital twin of a limb can help
                stimulate the effectiveness of a bionic limb
                digitally. This can simulate the stresses and
                strains the prosthetic can handle therefore,
                adjustments can be made to reduce adverse effects.
                This will greatly decrease the costs of designing
                many physical iterations of a bionic limb making this
                technology more accessible and safe.
            </p>
            <h3>Applying AI for Prosthetics Design</h3>
            <p>People are different from each other, we all have differnt traits and characteristics
                that set us apart, the same go for the protheses. One design may work for this person
                does not mean it can work for the other. The desing need to consider what body part will
                it need to be replace, where the patient was amputated. This process can be shorten through the
                applycation of AI. </p>
            <h3>Impact on future life</h3>
             <p>The research and developments of neuroprosthetics to use electrodes to interface with the nervous system will greatly improve bionic body parts. This new method of input and output will simulate exactly the same seamless movements of a natural body part. This will ultimately improve the mobility and the quality of life for individual as the prosthesis will seem as life like as if they had never lost a limb.</p>
