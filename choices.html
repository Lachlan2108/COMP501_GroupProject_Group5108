	    <p><b>What choices could be made to further advance Stereo vision in cars?</b></p>
            <p> One way we could further advance Stereo vision by our different choices is by using a set of code to calculate what objects are get the speed of said objects what direction/where it is placed on the road. By doing this it allows the cameras to pick up more than just the depth so it can see where it is on the road and what’s near them and how it can avoid them. If this were implemented people may be more comfortable with autonomous vehicles. The mass production and use of stereo vision cameras in cars will impact the future by not only making it affordable for a wide variety of consumers to use/buy but also make the roads more safer by mitigating the amount of accidents/deaths caused by reckless driving.</p> 
            <p>Based on a study in UK, (Maddox, 2018), “self-driving cars, could reduce traffic fatalities by up to 94 percent by eliminating those accidents that are due to human error.”. This study backs up the point that if were to choose to further advance the capability and availability of stereo vision cameras in cars, we are able to reduce the amount of accidents occuring due to human errors or reckless driving.</p>

	    <p><b>How will Stereo vision impact the future in terms of autonomous driving?</b></p>
	    <p>Our choices can impact the direction stereo vision cameras in cars goes, as if we were to decide that stereo vision in cars is not needed, it will halt the advancement of it however if we were to think of it another way and think of stereo vision as a necessity for safe driving. It will not only make its capability up to par with others but it will also mitigate the amount of accidents.  This is as it’ll allow the car to perceive depth on the road as well as with the additional use of some code will be able to detect and send information to the cloud for other vehicles to see damage to the road, accidents, road works, etc. Stereo visions capability to perceive depth also allows the car to see how far away objects are from the car. This study (Appiah, 2022), tells us that it could help cause less accidents on the road seeing as the cars camera will pick up a problem and deal with it asap with the either being moving aside, pulling over, and or stopping in its tracks.</p>
            <p> By making small changes bit by bit it will lead to a better future. Such as creating EV stations so that people who own autonomous cars are able to go there to charge there vehicle. Companies such as Tesla created EV stations around the world and made it even better as they made some EV stations free of charge which encourages people to buy autonomous cars and use there EV station.</p>
