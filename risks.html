            <h2>Risks</h2>
            <p>
                Bionic body parts are electronic devices that require computers and firmware for it to function. As modern
            prosthetics are becoming more accessible there are ethical risks of security risks from hackers or firmware
            bugs which can endanger people. Prosthetics can become a target for hackers to extort and control the
            wellbeing of a individual. Firmware bugs can also can also endanger the health of users such as the example
            of the St. Judeâ€™s pacemaker which had to be recalled as firmware bugs caused the device to fail to maintain
            the users heartbeat.<br><br>
            Despite the breakthroughs of artificial body parts from just being cosmetic to becoming functional or
            enhancing, it is still nowhere like how we imagine it like in sci-fi films. Bionic arms and legs are powered
            by batteries that needs to be charged everyday for it to function. There are limitations with our current
            technology on how effective the functionality of bionic prosthetics. <br><br>
            
            There are also numerous potential issues of bone fractures, infection, comfort and implant stability which
            can significantly impact the wellbeing of the user. These are just some common negative effects if patients
            have the money and accessibility for the treatment.

        <h2>Ethics</h2>
        <img div id="floated" src="images/artificial_arm.jpg">
        <h4>Identity</h4>
        <p>
            Reciving an artificial implatation can have a major affect on the person identity. They have to accept the
            face that they have to rely on a piece of technology to maintain a level of independence. This may have
            detrimental affect on their self image, causing them to view themselve as something less then a human.
            Some citics agree with this viewpoint , saying that with the increase of cybernetic enchancement, all the
            flaw and defect that make us human
        </p>
        <h4>Culture </h4>
        <p>
            Artificial Implatation not only has effect on the people who the procedure was performed on but also society
            as well. Some disable community view the risen of the implactation as a threat to the continuance of the
            community. For example, the history and culture of the deaf community may end up being destroy by the risen
            of cochleat implant.
            
        </p>
        <h4>Justice</h4>
        <p>
            With the developed of artificial protheses and implants, many question regarding the issue of distributing
            justice: Will the be a division between the people who has artificial implant / protheses and people who
            don't? Will all be able to access th implants that are customized to their biological traits and thier way
            of life?
