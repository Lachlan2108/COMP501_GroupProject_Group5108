            <h2>Risks</h2>
            <p>
                Bionic body parts are electronic devices that require computers and firmware to function. As modern
                prosthetics are becoming more accessible, there are ethical security risks from hackers or firmware bugs
                that can endanger people. Prosthetics can become a target for hackers to extort and control the
                wellbeing of an individual. Firmware bugs can also threaten users' health, such as the St. Jude's
                pacemaker, which had to be recalled as firmware bugs that caused the device to fail to maintain the
                user's heartbeat.<br><br>
                Despite the breakthroughs of artificial body parts from just being cosmetic to becoming functional or
                enhancing, it is still nowhere like how we imagine it like in sci-fi films. Bionic arms and legs are
                powered by batteries that need to be charged daily to function. There are limitations with our current
                technology on how effective the functionality of bionic prosthetics is. <br><br>

                There are also numerous potential issues of bone fractures, infection, comfort and implant stability
                which can significantly impact the user's wellbeing. These are just some common adverse effects if
                patients have the money and accessibility for the treatment.
            </p>
            <h2>Ethics</h2>
            <img div id="floated" src="images/artificial_arm.jpg">
            <h4>Identity</h4>
            <p>
                Receiving artificial implantation can have a significant effect on a person's identity. They have to
                accept that they have to rely on a piece of technology to maintain a level of independence. Therefore,
                this may have a detrimental effect on their self-image, causing them to view themselves as something
                less than a human. Some critics agree with this viewpoint, saying that with the increase of cybernetic
                enhancement, all the flaws and defects that make us human.
            </p>
            <h4>Culture </h4>
            <p>
                Artificial implantation not only has an effect on the people on who the procedure was performed but also
                on society as well. Some disabled communities view the risen of implantation as a threat to the
                continuance of the community. For example, the history and culture of the deaf community may end up
                being destroyed by the risen of cochlear implants.

            </p>
            <h4>Justice</h4>
            <p>
                With the development of artificial prostheses and implants, many questions regarding the issue of
                distributing justice: Will there be a division between the people who have artificial
                implants/prostheses and those who don't? Will all be able to access the implants that are customized to
                their biological traits and their way of life? Because the workings of machines will influence the
                behaviour or cognitive processes of their wearers, bionic and neuroprosthetic implants may raise
                problems of accountability. Who is to blame if such people cause accidents or make poor decisions: them
                or their implants?
            </p>
            <h4>Bionic Augmentation</h4>
            <p>
                Human augmentation's ethical implications. Human augmentation raises a number of ethical issues in
                addition to those mentioned previously. Is it ever morally acceptable to destroy or impair healthy human
                limbs or organs to accommodate an augmentation, especially if the destruction is irreversible? Can an
                employer require or place a premium on an employee's ability to perform enhanced functions? Part of the
                debate over human augmentation has centred on military applications, specifically the creation of
                super-soldiers. Should military research be devoted to developing a super-soldier through implants,
                integrated weaponry, genetically altered muscles and lightning-fast artificial nerves? If certain
                augmentations become very popular, there is a risk that they will be accepted as the standard, and
                people who do not have one will be considered disabled.</p>
