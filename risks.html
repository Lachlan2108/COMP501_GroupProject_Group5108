        <h2>Risks</h2>
        <p>Bionic body parts are electronic devices that require computers and firmware for it to function. As modern prosthetics are becoming more accessible there are ethical risks of security risks from hackers or firmware bugs which can endanger people. Prosthetics can become a target for hackers to extort and control the wellbeing of a individual. Firmware bugs can also can also endanger the health of users such as the example of the St. Judeâ€™s pacemaker which had to be recalled as firmware bugs caused the device to fail to maintain the users heartbeat.
            <br><br>
            Despite the breakthroughs of artificial body parts from just being cosmetic to becoming functional or enhancing, it is still nowhere like how we imagine it like in sci-fi films. Bionic arms and legs are powered by batteries that needs to be charged everyday for it to function. There are limitations with our current technology on how effective the functionality of bionic prosthetics. 
            <br><br>
            There are also numerous potential issues of bone fractures, infection, comfort and implant stability which can significantly impact the wellbeing of the user. These are just come common negative effects if patients have the money and accessibility for the treatment.
