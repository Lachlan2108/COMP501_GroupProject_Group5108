        <h2>Risks</h2>
        <p>
            Despite the significant improvements of Stereo vision, it still hasn’t been developed to the point where it performs well in all environments it is implemented in. When it is used in a low light environment, performance rapidly drops. Therefore, if it were to be put into this situation it could put the driver at risk.
        </p>
        <p>
            One of the most notable risk of stereo vision is that the Stereo vision cameras become un-calibrated over time when using it and will require occasional manual adjustments. This requires special training and qualifications to perform and most of the knowledge required is not already standard.
        </p>
        <h2>Ethics</h2>
        <img div id="floated" src="images/mobilephone.jpg">
        <p>
            Many ethical quandaries come from the use of stereo vision in self driving cars and the new roles around governing them. The development of stereo vision along with its implementation on our roads will lead to both privacy and cybersecurity risks. Information is gathered from the use of stereo vision in our cars and when information is held by an external entity, it can be abused and mistreated.
        </p>

        <p>
            Many ethical issues arise from the collection of information from stereo vision technologies such as; why the information is being collected, who can access the information and for how long should the information be carried. Information gathered from stereo vision is used to inform road conditions as well as the active road state for the car to determine what it should be doing. However, this information also reveals the location of the driver and could contain private information depending on where the car is located.

        <p>
            The ethical issues that arise from the use of this data collection from stereo vision and Automatic Vehicles can be considered similar to the privacy issues that we saw arise with the mobile phone. During the rise of the mobile phone in the 2000s, information collection via personal devices started to skyrocket with many different reasonings for doing so.
            One of which, was the use of the data to monitor possible threats to communities such as terror attacks. In the 2005 London bombings, data capture from mobile phones was used in order to help capture the perputrators. In this particular case, pictures taken of the attackers were used from witnesses and survivors in order to help catch them, but
            we have also seen how when this information collection is unchecked, our privacy can be extorted for capital gain. This is shown in the use of behavioural advertising which uses mobile phone information and internet usage in order to advertise to certain demographics.
