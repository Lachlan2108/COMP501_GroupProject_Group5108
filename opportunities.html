            <p>Modern Technology had made life more convenient in all aspects, especially in terms of Stereo vision in the context of autonomous driving. Due to the advancement of stereo vision. Stereo vision is able to allow the car to perceive depth more clearly on the road, as it is able to identify and point out potholes, people or/and anything in its area that may act as a hazard. With the help of Stereo vision is able to act upon discovering these hazards on the road and do everything to notify the driver what to do to avoid encountering the hazard by either slowing down, moving around it or stopping immediately. hazards on the road and do everything to notify the driver what to do to avoid encountering the hazard by either slowing down, moving around it or stopping immediately. This is what could lead/act as the stepping stone to the future where cars are entirely running off these cameras without the assistance of drivers/presence of drivers. </p>
        <br 
            <p>Another significant opportunity that Stereovision has created is that the current Stereo vision is able to act as a base and is flexible enough to the point where car companies are able to add modifications to improve their type of autonomous driving/stereo vision cameras for the use of awareness around the car. An example of a car company using Stereo vision as a base and adding modifications is Mercedes. As seen in (Roberts, 2021), Mercedes has modified the Stereo vision camera by fully integrating hardware and perception software in order to maximise the efficiency and quality of automated driving. These are only a few modifications that  Mercedes has added to aid autonomous driving. Another example of car companies using Stereo vision cameras as a base is Suzuki, as seen on this website (Roberts, 2021), Suzuki has modified Stereo vision to the point where it is able to feature nighttime pedestrian detection and supports a substantial amount of Advanced Driver assistance systems. With this type of modification, it is able to create a significant opportunity for the future of stereo vision. This is because, as of now, stereo vision does not perform optimally during nighttime/low-lit environments, therefore Suzuki being able to implement night vision into stereo vision is very revolutionary.</p>
        <br>  
            <p>Another opportunity that Stereo vision in cars creates is that it is very affordable. Due to Stereo vision cameras being very affordable it allows many car companies such as Suzuki, Tesla, Honda, Subaru and many other huge car manufacturers. Because of this various companies were made to further improve Stereo vision in cars such as Veoneer. Veoneer is able to distribute enhanced stereo vision cameras in cars more frequently with its cutting edge as they are very affordable they can make a lot of changes without spending too much. An example of them making changes due to its affordable price is that their Stereo vision system allows them to have Adaptive cruise control, Automatic emergency breaks, Parking assistance and many other features that are vital to mitigating accidents from occurring. This is seen in ("Vision Systems", 2022)</p>
        <br> 
            <p>And finally, the last and most important opportunity that stereo vision in cars brings is that it allows autonomous cars to react almost instantaneously upon discovering hazards on the road. Which then does everything to notify the driver what to do to avoid encountering the hazards by either slowing down, moving around it or stopping immediately. This is only possible with the further improvements we have been making to stereo vision. </p>
