            <h2>Ethical Reflections</h2>
            <h3>Lachlan Pearce</h3>
            <p>
                The first point I want to make is whether or not a person should have the right to choose to have a
                bionic technology implanted in their body. Many people would say that a person should have the right to
                choose what happens to their body, even if it means choosing to have a bionic technology implanted.
                However, there are also people who would say that this type of technology should only be used when
                absolutely necessary, such as when a person has lost a limb.
            </p>
            <p>
                The second point I would like to make is related to the first one and has to do with the safety of
                bionic technology. There are many people who are concerned about the safety of bionic technology and
                whether or not it is safe for humans to use. There have been some reports of people who have had bionic
                technology implants who have experienced complications, such as infections.
            </p>
            <p>
                The third point I would like to make is about the long-term effects of bionic technology. There is not a
                lot of research on the long-term effects of bionic technology, so we don't really know what could happen
                to a person if they use this technology for an extended period of time. There are some people who are
                concerned that the long-term effects of bionic technology could be harmful to a person's health.
            </p>
            <p>
                Lastly, overall I believe that helping disabled or impaired people with this technology is amazing and
                will be life-changing, but I am concerned about the long-term effects of the other uses of this tech
                enhancing people above human capabilities.
            </p>
            <h3>Cuong Nguyen</h3>
            <p>
                With the increasing usage of bionic people, there are several points I would like to address: The effect
                of bionic people in military/warfare, the change in the use of a current weapon to accommodate them with
                the rise of cybernetic augmentation and the shift in the employment process.
            </p>
            <p>
                The first point is will the military force the soldiers to use artificial implantation such as eyes for
                scanning, aiming and legs for optimal movement. Will the implantation be given as a choice for the
                soldiers with the missing body? Will the soldiers get to keep the limbs after they retire or get a
                replacement that is more suitable for daily life?
            </p>
            <P>
                Another point related to the military is the usage of current military technology. The increase of
                bionic people may add more effect to the current weapons. For example, the EMP (Electromagnetic pulse),
                at the moment, EMP does not affect organic lifeform. However, it can temporarily or permanently disable
                electrical and electronic equipment. The artificial implantation will receive heavy damage, and this can
                range from not working arms or legs to having the artificial organ fried inside you.
            </P>
            <p>
                The last point is similar to the first point, but on a broader aspect, can the employer require the
                employee to have enhanced functions or favour the employee who possesses such functions?
            </p>

            <h3>Ryan Garcia</h3>
            <p>As bionic technology becomes more prevalent in the future ethical questions presented by the rapid
                development of this branch of medicine will have to be debated. Health and safety are significant
                issues. The functionality of a couple of clinical trials with human subjects or a few animal tests
                cannot reliably predict the functionality of a prosthesis for a person's lifespan. As a result, there is
                a real danger that people will be fitted with implants. Prostheses or implants that fail, have adverse
                side effects, or are even rejected by the body's autoimmune system, such as artificial hearts, have
                already demonstrated the body's resistance to technological advances. The ideal solution is to test the
                prosthesis over many years or decades and a large number of human test subjects. Problems with this are
                the extensive cost and experimental and clinical trials on humans as test subjects also raise ethical
                issues. Animal testing for prosthetics is not a worthy alternative which also presents problems.
            </p>
            <p>
                Identity is the next ethical concern. Acquiring a prosthesis requires people to accept that a part of
                their body is artificial and that their biological work is dependent on a piece of technology. This may
                be intensified by bionic and neuroprosthetic implants, which may display or induce behaviours that are
                only partially controlled by the user and with which we may struggle to identify. Moreover, the rapid
                development of cognitive prosthetics to enhances cognitive function. This could directly undermine
                identity as they interface with the mind. Some opponents of prosthetics have argued for the integrity of
                the human body, with all of its flaws and defects have expressed concern that as we become more
                artificial, the essence of our humanity and social identity could be lost.
