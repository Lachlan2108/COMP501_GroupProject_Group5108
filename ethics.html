        <h2>Ethical Reflections</h2>
        <h3>Jamie Corstorphine 21155713</h3>
        <p>
            There are many ethical quandaries that arise from the use of stereo vision in self driving cars. Safety and privacy are two very important aspects to us that could be put at risk without us putting further development into the technologies and laws
            that we will be implementing. Firstly, the risk to human life that could be caused, without immense and detailed interrogation of the stereo vision technologies we are trying to use, is too high as is. Secondly, the gaping breach in privacy that
            we would be exposed to immediately if the technology was implemented at the moment would be astronomical. We have previously and currently experience what damage these sort of breaches in our privacy can do in our personal lives. As a result, there
            needs to be sweeping changes and regulations to be put in place before we move to a complete use of stereo vision on our roads.
        </p>
        <p>
            The solution to the problem of safety with the use of stereo vision technology is fairly simple. The current issues that are active with the technology is well known and is constantly being worked on. When environments are unpredictable and the stereo
            vision cameras cannot perform as well as expected, other technologies to either enhance how they work or safety measures that could be implemented are currently being developed. The main issue with what is happening, is with the current use of these
            technologies on our roads. The information as to what needs to change to keep people safe is not completely available yet, but we are still using the technology on our roads. While arguments have been made regarding how the number of casualties due to faulty 
            self-driving car technology are generally lower than regularly driven cars, the demographic of people who are currently using self driving car functions and have access to them is extremely small in comparison to manually driven car drivers. Overall,
            the statistics we are provided are skewed to favour good conditions for self-driving cars such as well lit urban or suburban areas or motorways and as such, stereo vision will generally be at its highest efficiency.
        </p>
        <p>
            The second problem, however, will not be solved so easily. The ethical issues surrounding privacy of information has been a huge issue in the past and continues to be until today. Many people are unaware of the information that most large companies have access
            to and even more people are unaware of the negative effects of this. The increased commoditisation of our world has contributed to the largest amount of wealth inequality the world has ever seen and the use and sale of our information has pushed this greatly.
            When mobile phones were introduced, we were left exposed to the unforeseen attacks on privacy that have never been experienced before. Having a device that we willingly provided as much information to as possible without limiting the use of this information by
            third parties has left scars on our society that have not and probably will not heal from. The last thing we need is to expose ourselves and others a second time. Time needs to be given to properly introduce laws and regulations that took years to develop after mobile
            phones became widespread. Allowing self-driving cars to create another gap in our privacy should be avoided as much as possible.
        </p>
        <p>
            Overall, self-driving cars and their use of stereo vision has the potential to drastically change our roads for the better. However, we are not at the stage where we can fully rely on them just yet. Fully embracing the technologies they use at the moment would
            leave us exposed to potential safety issues and also privacy issues that could negatively impact society for years to come. I suggest that the best course of action would be to focus on the two areas of developing the technologies to work under more strenuous 
            environments and to also develop the legal safety nets required to stop the misuse of our information. We are almost there when it comes to self-driving cars that are reliable and helpful to society and we shouldn't be overeager to also have them damage our society.

            I think that Stereo Vision in cars will play a huge part in contributing to an autonomous driving future. Depending on how people can adapt to the changes from manual driving to autonomous driving is what plays a part in whether stereo vision will advance further and 
            improve on its capabilities or hinder its improvement. Companies that had chosen to further improve stereo vision capabilities in autonomous cars are Tesla, Honda & etc. From my point of view, several opportunities come from the stereo vision in cars however some risks 
            come with the opportunities. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Based on my research, I have discovered several advantages/opportunities and these advantages are very vital in mitigating accidents from occurring. In general, autonomous driving has saved thousands of lives by reducing the number of accidents that occur due to human 
            errors on the road. As of recently, Stereo vision cameras have had some very notable weaknesses such as performing very poorly when situated in low-lit environments. However, due to the stereo vision in cars being very versatile it allows companies to make changes and 
            tweaks on it to make it so that it can perform in all environments in its best condition. One of the most notable things that I noticed about how stereo vision performs is that it can almost instantaneously react when the car/driver discovers a potential hazard on the 
            road. I strongly believe that in the future if we all make the right choices and decisions in furthering the advancement of stereo vision/autonomous cars we can go on the road without worrying about human errors that normally will cause accidents as autonomous driving 
            will take over the industry.
        </p>
        <p>
            On the other hand, despite all these advantages that stereo vision in cars have, it is bound to have some risks that come with it. The risks which I see as huge disadvantages to stereo vision in cars is that over time stereo vision becomes uncalibrated which causes the
            accuracy of the camera to plummet causing it to be un-safe and could lead to an accident as the car itself is a hazard on the road. Another risk that is bound due to the opportunities of mitigating accidents is that car companies can receive data from the cloud where the 
            camera sends the information when in an accident with or without your consent. Through research we have found out that car companies such as Tesla will gather the data from everyone who uses their autonomous vehicle, This, in my opinion, is a double-edged sword as, one it 
            may allow tesla to gather information to further improve their autonomous driving by fixing all the malfunctions however this means that the Tesla company will get your data with or without your knowledge/consent. This is very invasive of privacy as Tesla is getting 
            information without your knowledge and it is a breach of the customer's ethics.
        </p>
        <p>
            The choices for the future application of stereo vision in cars, to a great extent of it, revolve around the choice of whether we are willing to adapt to the modern world and further advance the ways of autonomous driving. In conclusion, I would say that stereo vision has 
            its fair shares of advantages and disadvantages, however, I would think that the advantages outweigh the disadvantages/risks of stereo vision in cars. I think that autonomous cars with the help of stereo vision cameras can mitigate human error accidents from occurring however 
            if left unchecked by a licensed person, the car will not be mitigating human error accidents but be the reason that causes the accidents.

        <p>
            After the research that I have done I have come to the opinion that stereo vision could be one of the major driving factors that lead to autonomous vehicles. I believe it is one of the best ways to speed up the process of self-driving vehicles in our society. With self-driving 
            vehicles it could cause a lot more benefits for humans in multiple ways from less fatal accidents to more improved roads etc. I believe that it will either take off and become very important in this field or it will be left behind. I had noticed that a few leading car companies 
            are taking charge with stereo vision. They include kia, tesla etc. I believe that the way tesla especially is using stereo vision is not too far from a completely self-driving vehicle. Their cars already can drive for limited amounts of time by themselves and can even come to you
            (not too far of a distance, more like from a parking lot to you 500m away.) 
        </p>
        <p>
            Through the research I have done I have noticed that there are many positives of this and also alongside are negatives/risks. One major negative at the moment is that the technology at the moment is not quite good enough to fully utilize stereo vision, which leads to another 
            problem being that stereo vision relies heavily on the software that it runs off of, seeing as all stereo vision is, is just multiple cameras capturing depth. For this to be properly utilized in vehicles the software must be completely up to date and work perfectly 100% of the
            time, our current software is not able to completely run a vehicle autonomously for this to work we will need a company to create a software powerful enough to run the car. But this also brings a massive opportunity for any company who can create a software of which works in 
            even a minor way better than currently. Many advancements can be made in this space which will be interesting to see in the future.
        </p>
        <p>
            As seen from the statements above stereo vision could play a very important role in the automotive industry in the future this could cause a lot less problems on the road if the technology is created to do so but until then stereo vision can only be used in smaller ways, but in 
            saying that it does open a world of opportunities for any automotive company willing to go with creating the software need.
