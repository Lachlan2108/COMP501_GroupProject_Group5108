        <h2>Ethical Reflections</h2>
        <h3>Lachlan Pearce</h3>
            <p>
                The first point I would like to make is whether or not a person should have the right to choose to have a bionic technology implanted in their body. 
                There are many people who would say that a person should have the right to choose what happens to their body, even if it means choosing to have a bionic 
                technology implanted. However, there are also people who would say that this type of technology should only be used when absolutely necessary, such as when 
                a person has lost a limb.
            </p>
            <p>
                The second point I would like to make is related to the first one and has to do with the safety of bionic technology. There are many people who are concerned
                 about the safety of bionic technology and whether or not it is safe for humans to use. There have been some reports of people who have had bionic technology
                  implants who have experienced complications, such as infections.
            </p>
            <p>
                The third point I would like to make is about the long-term effects of bionic technology. There is not a lot of research on the long-term effects of bionic 
                technology, so we don't really know what could happen to a person if they use this technology for an extended period of time. There are some people who are 
                concerned that the long-term effects of bionic technology could be harmful to a person's health.
            </p>
            <p>
                Lastly, overall I believe that helping disabled or impaired people with this technology is amazing and will be life-changing, but I am concerned about the 
                long-term effects of the other uses of this tech enhancing people above human capabilities.
