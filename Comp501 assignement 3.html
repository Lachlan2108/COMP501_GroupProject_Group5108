                    <h2>Definition</h2>
                </center>
                <p> Artificial body parts are artificial devices that are used to replace or support a person's missing
                    natural body part due to disease, injury or genetic defects. Bionic people are people who have been
                    fitted with artificial body parts. The type of prosthesis a person can use is determined by factors
                    such as the cause of amputation or limb loss, as well as the location of the missing limb.
                    <br><br>
                    In our context, Artificial body parts and bionic people are the use of electronics or prosthetics to
                    aid humans in completing day-to-day living that they might not be able to do without.

                    <h2>The importance of Advancements of Bionic Technology in Restoring Body Parts.</h2>
                </center>
                <p> There are a few potential importance of artificial body parts and bionic people. First, it could
                    help those who have lost a body part due to an accident or illness to regain some level of function.
                    Second, it could also help people who were born with a congenital disability to have a more normal
                    life. Third, it could be used for people who want to enhance their physical abilities beyond what is
                    possible with natural body parts. Finally, it could be used for military or law enforcement
                    purposes, such as increasing strength, speed, or stamina or adding special abilities like night
                    vision or x-ray vision.

                    <h2>Justification</h2>
                </center>
                <p> The use of artificial body parts dates back thousands of years, with early examples including wooden
                    and metal prosthetic limbs. In more recent years, advances in medical technology have led to the
                    development of increasingly sophisticated artificial body parts, such as cochlear implants,
                    artificial hearts, and artificial limbs with integrated electronics.
                    <br><br>
                    The use of artificial body parts can improve the quality of life for individuals with disabilities
                    or chronic health conditions. For example, individuals who have lost a limb can regain the ability
                    to walk with the help of a prosthetic limb. Similarly, individuals who are deaf can benefit from
                    cochlear implants, which allow them to hear again.
                    <br><br>
                    There are also ethical and social implications associated with the use of artificial body parts. For
                    example, some people argue that the use of artificial body parts blurs the line between humans and
                    machines and that this could have dangerous consequences for society. Others say that the use of
                    artificial body parts is a positive development that can help people to live fuller and more
