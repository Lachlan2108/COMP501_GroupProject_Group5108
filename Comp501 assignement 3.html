	<h2>Definition</h2>
                
                <p> Artificial body parts are man-made devices that are used to replace or support a person's natural body parts. Bionic people are people who have been fitted with artificial body parts.
                    <br><br>
                    In our context Artificial body parts and bionic people are the use of electronics and/or prosthetics to aid a humans in completing day to day living that they might not be able to do without.                     
			</p>

                    <h2>The importance of Advancements of Bionic Technology in Restoring Body Parts.</h2>
                    <p> There are a few potential importance of artificial body parts and bionic people. First, it could help those who have lost a body part due to an accident or illness to regain some level of function. 
                        Second, it could also help people who were born with a congenital defect to have a more normal life. Third, it could be used for people who want to enhance their physical abilities beyond what is possible 
                        with natural body parts. Finally, it could be used for military or law enforcement purposes, such as increasing strength, speed, or stamina, or adding special abilities like night vision or x-ray vision.
                    </p>

<h3>Justification</h3>
<p> The use of artificial body parts dates back thousands of years, with early examples including wooden and metal prosthetic limbs. In more recent years, advances in medical technology have led to the development of increasingly 
    sophisticated artificial body parts, such as cochlear implants, artificial hearts, and artificial limbs with integrated electronics. 
    <br><br>
    The use of artificial body parts can improve the quality of life for individuals with disabilities or chronic health conditions. For example, 
    individuals who have lost a limb can regain the ability to walk with the help of a prosthetic limb. Similarly, individuals who are deaf can benefit from cochlear implants, which allow them to hear again.
    <br><br>
    There are also ethical and social implications associated with the use of artificial body parts. For example, some people argue that the use of 
    artificial body parts blurs the line between human and machine and that this could have dangerous consequences for society. Others argue that the use of artificial body parts is a positive development that can help people to live fuller and more
